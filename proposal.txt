**Project Summary**

We propose to develop a Python bot that will copy deals from two platforms, Api Master and Api Copy, and send notifications to the client via a Telegram bot. The bot will be designed to be secure and efficient, and will meet the client's requirements for deal value and notification preferences.

**Project Understanding**

We have carefully analyzed your requirements and developed a clear project description. The project will be scoped to include the following tasks:

* Development of a Python bot that can copy deals from Api Master and Api Copy
* Development of a Telegram bot that can send notifications to the client
* Testing of the bots to ensure that they meet the client's requirements

**Solution Fit**

Our solution is designed to meet your requirements for a secure, efficient, and easy-to-use bot. The bot will be developed using Python, a language that is well-suited for this type of application. The bot will also be tested to ensure that it meets your requirements for deal value and notification preferences.

**Client-Centric Value**

Our project outline provides clarity to ensure that the project evolves in accordance with your vision. We will work closely with you to refine the project goals and ensure that the final product meets your needs.

**Invitation to Collaboration**

We invite you to collaborate with us on this project. We believe that your feedback is essential to the success of the project, and we are committed to working with you to ensure that the final product meets your expectations.

**Call to Action**

We would like to discuss a formal development plan with you. Please contact us at [email protected] to schedule a meeting.

**Outcome**

As part of the proof of concept, we will develop the following artifacts:

* SRS (Software Requirements Specification)
* Architecture
* Workflows
* Message sequence charts
* UI wireframes

These artifacts will demonstrate our ability to develop a high-quality software product that meets your requirements.
